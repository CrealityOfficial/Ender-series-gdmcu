# Ender Series firmware （GD MCU）

This firmware contains Ender 3, Ender 3 Pro, Ender 3Max, Ender 5Pro, Ender 2Pro.

## Special explanation 
We explain GD MCU as a replacement due to the global MCU supply issues.

We are afraid that there are some issues with other ender series products except above we mentioned, so it isn't recommended to use GD MCU firmware on other Ender series machines.

## Difference between GD MCU and ST MCU
GD MCU firmware can be compatible with ST MCU firmware, but ST MCU firmware can't be compatible with GD MCU alone.
